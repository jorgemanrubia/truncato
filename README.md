# truncato

*truncato* is a Ruby library for truncating HTML strings keeping the markup valid.

## Installing

In your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'truncato'
```

## Usage

```ruby
Truncato.truncate "<p>some text</p>", max_length: 4 => "<p>s...</p>"
Truncato.truncate "<p>some text</p>", max_length: 4, count_tags: false => "<p>some...</p>"
```

The configuration options are:

* `max_length`: The size, in characters, to truncate (`30` by default)
* `tail`: The string to append when the truncation occurs ('...' by default)
* `count_tags`: Boolean value indicating whether tags size should be considered when truncating (`true` by default)
* `filtered_attributes`: Array of attribute names that will be removed from the output. This allows you to make the truncated string shorter by excluding the content of attributes you can discard in some given context, e.g HTML `style` attribute.
* `tail_before_final_tag`: Boolean value indicating whether to apply a tail before the final closing tag (`false` by default)
* `comments`: Boolean value indicating whether to include comments in parsed results (`false` by default)
* `count_tail`: Boolean value indicating whether to include the tail within the bounds of the provided max length (`false` by default)

## Performance

Truncato was designed with performance in mind. Its main motivation was that existing libs couldn't truncate a multiple-MB document into a few-KB one in a reasonable time. It uses the [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/) SAX parser.

There is a benchmark included that generates a synthetic XML of 4MB and truncates it to 400 KB. You can run the benchmark using

```ruby
rake truncato:benchmark
```

There is a also a comparison benchmark that tests the previous data with other alternatives

```ruby
rake truncato:vendor_compare
```

The results comparing truncato with other libs:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Truncato</th>
    <th><a href="https://github.com/ianwhite/truncate_html">truncate_html</a></th>
    <th><a href="https://github.com/nono/HTML-Truncator">HTML Truncator</a></th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Time for truncating a 4MB XML document to 4KB</th>
    <td>1.5 s</td>
    <td>20 s</td>
    <td>220 s</td>
    <td>232 s</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Running the tests

```ruby
rake spec
```
